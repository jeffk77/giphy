# Giphy Search App:

Assignment #6 - U of T Bootcamp


# Description:

The Giphy Search App utilizes the Giphy API, along with simple user input data, to create an interface to search for GIF's under a particular theme. The results are not technically limited to the "movies" theme, but the pre-entered buttons offer a number of film suggestions. The results are limited to 10 as per the directions.
